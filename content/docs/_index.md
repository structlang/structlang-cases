👋 Hello! Welcome to the MainStruct documentation!

# MainStruct · The Next Cognitive Language

**Complexity isn’t infinite. It’s structured.**  
MainStruct reveals the hidden logic behind how humans think, decide, and act — and translates it into a universal language that both people and AI can use.

---

## Why another framework?

The world already has many theories and tools. But each one only sees **part of the picture**:

- **Psychology (CBT, Personality Tests)** → Focuses on traits or emotions, but struggles with dynamic, real-time change.
    
- **Game Theory** → Models rational choices, but ignores uncertainty, fear, and subjective intentions.
    
- **System Dynamics** → Captures feedback loops, but too abstract for everyday or organizational decisions.
    
- **AI & Neural Nets** → Powerful predictions, but trapped in “black box” logic, lacking human-level explainability.
    

---

## What makes MainStruct different?

- **Dynamic** → Captures shifting states (intention × ability × attitude) instead of static labels.
    
- **Cross-Domain** → Works in business, education, health, politics, psychology, strategy — not just relationships.
    
- **Computable** → 64 fundamental modes = a “Periodic Table of Human Behavior,” ready for AI integration.
    
- **Explainable** → Turns intuition into clear logic, bridging human wisdom and machine reasoning.
    
- **Predictive** → Identifies not only current states, but also likely transitions and triggers of change.

## Comparison at a Glance

|Field / Framework|Strengths|Limitations|What MainStruct Adds|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Personality Tests (MBTI, Big Five)**|Easy to use, popular|Static, labels people, poor prediction|Dynamic structure: same person in different contexts has different codes|
|**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**|Evidence-based, clinical|Narrow to therapy, not generalizable|Universal structural model for any domain, not just clinical use|
|**Game Theory**|Rigorous, mathematical|Assumes rationality, ignores emotions|Models real subjective intentions, conflicts, and irrational dynamics|
|**System Dynamics**|Captures feedback & complexity|Too abstract, weak on individual psychology|Makes complexity intuitive and human-readable|
|**AI / Deep Learning**|Powerful predictions|Opaque, black-box, lacks interpretability|Provides a symbolic “explainability layer” AI can compute and humans can understand|
|**Traditional Strategy Tools (SWOT, PESTEL)**|Simple, widely taught|Surface-level, ignores real human dynamics|Structural diagnosis: reveals the hidden intention–ability–attitude grid|

## Our Position

👉 **MainStruct = The next cognitive standard.**

- For **humans**: a practical tool to decode complexity, anticipate change, and design better strategies.
    
- For **AI**: a universal symbolic layer that turns “black box” outputs into explainable reasoning.
    

This is not just another personality test.  
Not just another management tool.  
Not just another AI model.

**It’s the language that connects them all.**
