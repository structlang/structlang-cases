{"/en/about/":{"data":{"":"Hextra is designed to be a simple, fast, and flexible theme for building modern static websites. It is especially well-suited for documentation websites but can also be used for various types of sites, such as blogs, portfolios, and more.\nHugo, like Jekyll, is a static site generator. What sets Hugo apart is that it is a single binary, making it easy to install and run on various platforms. It is also extremely fast and reliable, capable of rendering a site with thousands of pages in milliseconds.\nHextra is built with a mindset focused on having a minimal footprint. To get started, no extra dependencies like Node.js packages are required; all you need is a single YAML configuration file, along with your Markdown content. Thus, we can focus on writing quality content instead of setting up tooling.","credits#Credits":"Hextra cannot be built without the following tools and inspirations:\nHugo Tailwind CSS Heroicons Nextra Next.js"},"title":"About"},"/en/blog/":{"data":{"":"RSS Feed"},"title":"Blog"},"/en/blog/hextra-v0.10/":{"data":{"":"Hextra v0.10.0 is a big release packed with new capabilities, architectural upgrades, and quality-of-life improvements.\nIt also includes contributions from 10 new contributors and addresses long-standing community requests.\nUpgrade Guide\rImportant\nBreaking Changes: This release includes several breaking changes.

Predicts risks (conflict will repeat if unresolved). Offers systemic fixes (adjust mechanisms). Reusable patterns (seen in many teams).","example-complex-business-negotiation#Example: Complex Business Negotiation":"Company A wants to acquire Company B, involving many stakeholders.\nTraditional analysis: lists endless details — financials, market outlook, regulations, shareholders, employees, culture, etc. Looks overwhelming.\nStructural analysis instead identifies core patterns:\nCompany A: wants to acquire (+1) but fears overpaying (–1) → YN structure. Company B: wants to sell (+1) but fears poor terms (–1) → YN structure. B’s shareholders: want max returns (+1) but fear losing control (–1) → YN structure. A’s shareholders: support expansion (+1) but doubt the deal’s value (–1) → YN structure. Structural diagnosis: a “multi-party YN overlay” → everyone wants it, but all have concerns.\nStructural prediction: this usually causes drawn-out haggling, solvable with trust-building or phased deals.\nSuddenly, what looked impossibly complex is clear and actionable.","structural-analysis#Structural Analysis":"Role perspectives:\nLi: wants project success (+1) but fears tech risks (–1) → YN (responsible but lacks authority). Zhang: wants plan approved (+1) but feels challenged (–1) → YN (confident but pride hit). Others: want smooth project (+1) but avoid conflict (–1) → YN (bystanders). Diagnosis: A “dual YN clash” structure.\nLi: right concern, wrong timing/method. Zhang: valid authority, overreacted emotionally. Core issue: mismatch between responsibility vs authority. Prediction: If Li apologizes, flawed power dynamics harden; conflict repeats. True fix requires redefining roles.\nStructural solution:\nClarify roles: Li as PM has duty/right to question. Process optimization: pre-review sync avoids public clashes. Reframe authority: Zhang’s authority = answering, not blocking doubts. Cultural shift: distinguish “critiquing ideas” vs “attacking people.”","structural-simplification-principle#Structural Simplification Principle":"Any seemingly complex scenario can be broken down into finite basic elements:\nRoles: who are the players? Intentions: what do they want? Abilities: what can they do? Constraints: what holds them back? Relations: how are they positioned relative to one another? The combinations of these elements are limited. Like the periodic table of elements: endless materials, but only ~100 base elements.","summary-why-structural-thinking-matters#Summary: Why Structural Thinking Matters":"Traditional analysis is fundamentally flawed:\nDescribes but doesn’t explain: records phenomena, misses essence. Experience isn’t transferable: intuition remains personal, can’t be taught. Complexity exaggerated: attention lost in details, miss core structures. Superficial fixes: treat symptoms, root problem persists. Structural language offers a new lens:\nAny complex situation can be decomposed into finite structures. Any seasoned judgment can be expressed as structural recognition.\nMaster structural thinking, and you gain a superpower:\nTurn unspoken intuition into teachable methods, and turn messy situations into actionable strategies.\nThat’s why we must move from traditional analysis to structural analysis. Next, we’ll explore the structural essence of human thought—and why we’ve always been thinking this way.","the-core-features-of-structural-language#The Core Features of Structural Language":"Structural language takes a completely different approach:\nRelationship-centered: Focuses on the interactions and positional relations between roles. Multidimensional parallelism: Considers intentions, abilities, and constraints simultaneously. Explicit subjectivity: Always specifies “from whose standpoint” the analysis is made. Structural analysis: “From Wang’s perspective: he wanted to speak up (+1) but feared rejection (–1) → YN structure (wants to but dares not). From the facilitator’s perspective: needed diverse opinions (+1) but got no response from Wang (–1) → YN structure (wants participation but receives silence). Structural diagnosis: A classic misalignment between ‘willingness to express’ and ‘sense of safety in expression.’”\nSee the difference? Structural language isn’t guessing why Wang stayed silent. It describes the structural features of the state and what pathways this structure points toward.","the-essence-of-experience-structural-pattern-recognition#The Essence of Experience: Structural Pattern Recognition":"True experience is not the mere accumulation of facts, but the ability to recognize structural patterns.\nExperienced people don’t memorize every detail of past events. Instead, they quickly identify:\nThe true intentions of the parties involved. Their relative positions in the situation. And how such combinations usually evolve. For example, a veteran negotiator sees a look on the other side’s face and knows “they’re wavering.” Not because of facial semantics, but because they can read the structure:\n“Current state = wants to hold firm (+1) but doubts own bottom line (–1) = YN structure = usually leads to concession next round.”","the-essential-difference-between-descriptive-language-and-structural-language#The Essential Difference Between Descriptive Language and Structural Language":"We deal with complex realities every day: family conflicts, workplace struggles, business decisions, interpersonal disputes. When faced with these situations, we often rely on traditional methods of analysis—collecting information, summarizing experience, finding patterns, making strategies.\nBut have you noticed? Even with vast amounts of information, it’s still hard to predict outcomes accurately. Even with years of experience, a new context can leave us confused.\nThe root cause: we use descriptive language instead of structural language.","the-limitations-of-descriptive-language#The Limitations of Descriptive Language":"Traditional methods of analysis rely heavily on descriptive language, which has three main features:\nEvent-centered: Focuses on “what happened” rather than “why it happened that way.” Linear cause-and-effect thinking: Searches for simple A→B chains, ignoring complex interactions. Objectivity bias: Strives for a “single correct answer,” ignoring the importance of subjective standpoint. Example:\nDescriptive analysis: “Wang didn’t speak in the meeting → he might disagree with the plan → we need to talk privately.”\nThis seems reasonable, but it misses a crucial question: why did Wang choose not to speak? Was it disagreement, fear, or feeling he had no right to speak? Each reason points to a very different solution.","the-structural-basis-of-intuition#The Structural Basis of Intuition":"So-called “intuition” is really the brain’s rapid structural matching.\nWhen facing a new context, the brain automatically:\nIdentifies: What structural features define this situation? Matches: Have I seen this structure before? Recalls: How did similar structures evolve? Predicts: Projects likely outcomes via structural logic. This happens within seconds, so it feels like intuition—but it’s actually structured cognition.","three-sources-of-complexity#Three Sources of “Complexity”":"Information overload: details, histories, and contexts pile up. Multilateral games: each actor has their own stance and strategy. Dynamic change: the situation evolves constantly, timing is elusive. Yet, from another angle: complexity is often just the illusion of combinations.","traditional-analysis#Traditional Analysis":"Info gathering:\nLi: new hire, 6 months in. Zhang: senior expert, 5 years tenure. Project: core product. Zhang’s plan: technically risky. Company culture: conflict-averse. Analysis:\nLi might’ve rushed to impress, ignored context. Zhang might’ve felt authority challenged. Both had poor communication. Need mediation to restore cooperation. Solution:\nLi should apologize privately. Future dissent → private talks first. HR can mediate. Improve communication systems. Reasonable-sounding, but assumption-heavy and vague.","why-experienced-people-predict-more-accurately#Why “Experienced People” Predict More Accurately":"You’ve likely seen it: some people have uncanny intuition, reading situations quickly and predicting outcomes correctly. They’re often called “experienced” or “seasoned.”\nBut what is experience, really? Why does it transfer across fields and contexts?","why-some-experience-doesnt-transfer#Why Some Experience Doesn’t Transfer":"You’ve also seen this: someone excels in one field, but fails when context changes. That’s because they built surface experience, not structural experience.\nSurface experience: memorizing tactics and responses. Structural experience: grasping the relational patterns and evolution rules. Only structural experience transfers across domains, because while surface details differ, underlying structures often repeat."},"title":"Chapter 1 · Limitations of Traditional Analysis"},"/en/showcase/":{"data":{"":"Open source projects powered by Hextra\rBeginner Privacy\rClace\rRegolith Desktop\rModel Context Protocol Specification\rcellular_raza\rSidekick\rInstall C\rAXIVO Docs\rStanford CS 40\rHelix Docs\rClever Cloud Documentation\rOWASP AI Security and Privacy Guide\rOsuny\rPorter\rHITSZ OpenAuto\rLutheranConfessions\rHextra Starter Template"},"title":"Showcase"},"/en/test/":{"data":{"-部署成功本地测试页#🎉 部署成功（本地测试页）":"🎉 部署成功（本地测试页）这是本地测试页面。如果你能看到这段文字，说明 Hugo 路由正常。"},"title":"Hello MainStruct"}}
